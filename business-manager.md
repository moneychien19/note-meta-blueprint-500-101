Tasks for each asset are divided into two categories:
- **Standard access**: Toggle on each task you'd like the person to perform.
- **Admin access**: Toggle on admin access to allow the person to manage the asset and perform all available tasks.

> Scenario: A client creates a Business Manager for their Facebook Page. The client wants an agency that owns a separate Business Manager to also manage the Page.
>
