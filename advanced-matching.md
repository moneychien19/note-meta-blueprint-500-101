# Advanced Matching for Websites

# Introduction
Advanced matching can help you optimize your Facebook ads to produce better results. With advanced matching for websites, you can send Facebook **hashed customer information** along with your pixel events, which can help you **attribute more conversions** and reach more people.

You can only use advanced matching if people with **iOS 14.5+** devices **opt-in** on the Facebook or Instagram app on that device.

The process is as follow:
1. Capture hashed customer information, such as email addresses, that businesses collect from their website during checkout, account login, registration.
2. Transform the information into an indecipherable format through hashing.
3. Once Facebook receives that hashed data and the event, the system tries to match both with a customer.

## Value of Advanced Matching
- Help you understand the impact your ads have on website conversions.
- Increase your Custom Audience size.
- Enable you to deliver ads to the types of people who are likely to take the actions you want, which helps **conversion-optimized campaigns** operate more efficiently.

## Advanced Matching Methods
The two methods work differently, so you can use both to achieve maximum performance from advanced matching.

### Automatic Advanced Matching
Use this if
- you don't have a developer (this method doesn't require code modification).
- your website doesn't use an IMG pixel.
- your pixel isn't in an iFrame.
- your business isn't in regulated verticals such as investment banking and brokerage, insurance, financial services, retail, credit union and commercial banking, credit, financing, mortgage lending, pharmaceutical or health. 
- your business is using the Shopify platform.
- your site should have **form fields** where visitors will enter the relevant information, such as email addresses or phone numbers.

### Manual Advanced Matching
Use this if
- you can do code modification.
- your website uses an **IMG pixel**, in which case, you must manually format and hash customer information. 
- your pixel is in an **iFrame**. 
- your business is in a **regulated vertical**, which is prohibited from the use of the automatic version.
