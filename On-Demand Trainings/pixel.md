When customers visit to your website, they leave clues. If you have pixel installed, you can
- turn those behaviors into conversions.
- use them to build audiences.
- help optimize your camapaign.

The pixel captures intent signals in each stage during customer's journey:
- upper funnel intent, such as `view content` and `complete registration`.
- lower funnel intent, such as `add to cart` and `initiate checkout`.
- final conversion, that is `purchase`.

Tools and solutions the pixel powers are
- Dynamic ads: capture customer activities (intent signals).
- Value optimization: predict purchase value.
- Custom audiences: reach specific audiences.
- Conversions tracking: identify the devices your audiences use.
- Conversion optimization: reach people likely to convert.
- Conversion lift: test the effectiveness of your advertising.
